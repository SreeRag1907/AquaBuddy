# üîß ESP32 + React Native BLE Connection Guide

## üìã **Prerequisites**

### ESP32 Libraries Required:
```cpp
#include <BLEDevice.h>  // ESP32 BLE Arduino library
#include <BLEServer.h>
#include <BLEUtils.h>
#include <BLE2902.h>
#include <Wire.h>       // I2C communication
#include <VL53L0X.h>    // VL53L0X sensor library
```

### Arduino IDE Setup:
1. Install ESP32 board package
2. Install VL53L0X library by Adafruit or Pololu
3. Select your ESP32 board (ESP32 Dev Module)
4. Set correct COM port

## üîå **Hardware Connections**

### VL53L0X to ESP32:
- **VCC** ‚Üí 3.3V
- **GND** ‚Üí GND  
- **SDA** ‚Üí GPIO 4
- **SCL** ‚Üí GPIO 5
- **LED** ‚Üí GPIO 2 (status indicator)

## üì° **BLE Configuration**

### UUIDs (Must Match Both Sides):
- **Service UUID**: `4fafc201-1fb5-459e-8fcc-c5c9c331914b`
- **Characteristic UUID**: `beb5483e-36e1-4688-b7f5-ea07361b26a8`
- **Device Name**: `SmartWaterBottle`

## üöÄ **Step-by-Step Setup**

### 1. Upload ESP32 Code
- Use the provided `esp32_water_bottle.ino` file
- Monitor Serial output to verify:
  - VL53L0X sensor initialization
  - BLE service start
  - Device advertising

### 2. Test ESP32 Functionality
Expected Serial Output:
```
Starting Smart Water Bottle...
VL53L0X sensor initialized successfully
Characteristic defined! Now you can connect...
Device name: SmartWaterBottle
Distance: 142 mm
Distance: 140 mm
```

### 3. React Native App Connection
- Ensure Bluetooth is enabled
- Grant Bluetooth permissions
- Click "Connect to Bottle" button
- Check console logs for connection progress

## üîç **Troubleshooting**

### ESP32 Issues:

**Sensor Not Working:**
- Check wiring connections
- Verify 3.3V power supply
- Check I2C pins (SDA=4, SCL=5)
- Serial should show "VL53L0X sensor initialized successfully"

**BLE Not Advertising:**
- Check Serial Monitor for BLE start messages
- Verify ESP32 BLE library installation
- Try restarting ESP32
- LED should blink 3 times on successful init

**Connection Drops:**
- Check power supply stability
- Verify ESP32 is not sleeping
- Check antenna connection
- Keep devices within 5 meters

### React Native Issues:

**Device Not Found:**
- Enable Bluetooth and location services
- Grant all permissions
- Check device name matches exactly
- Try scanning with a BLE scanner app first

**Connection Fails:**
- Clear app cache
- Restart Bluetooth
- Check UUIDs match exactly
- Try from Android settings ‚Üí Paired devices

**No Data Received:**
- Check ESP32 Serial for data transmission
- Verify characteristic notifications are enabled
- Check JSON parsing in React Native logs

## üìä **Data Format**

ESP32 sends JSON data:
```json
{
  "distance": 142,
  "timestamp": 12345
}
```

React Native processes:
- Distance in millimeters
- Converts to water level percentage
- Updates UI in real-time

## üß™ **Testing Tools**

### BLE Scanner Apps:
- **nRF Connect** (Nordic Semiconductor)
- **BLE Scanner** 
- **LightBlue Explorer**

### Testing Steps:
1. Scan for "SmartWaterBottle"
2. Connect to device
3. Find service `4fafc201-1fb5-459e-8fcc-c5c9c331914b`
4. Enable notifications on characteristic
5. Verify data reception

## ‚ö° **Performance Tips**

- **Update Rate**: 2 seconds (configurable)
- **Range**: Keep within 10 meters
- **Battery**: Use deep sleep when not connected
- **Reliability**: Implement auto-reconnection

## üîß **Advanced Configuration**

### Modify Update Rate:
Change `delay(2000)` in ESP32 loop() function

### Adjust Sensor Range:
Modify timing budget: `sensor.setMeasurementTimingBudget(33000)`

### Custom Device Name:
Change `String deviceName = "SmartWaterBottle"`

## üìû **Quick Diagnostics**

If connection fails, check in this order:
1. ‚úÖ ESP32 LED status (should blink then stay on when connected)
2. ‚úÖ Serial output shows distance readings
3. ‚úÖ BLE scanner app can find and connect to device
4. ‚úÖ Android Bluetooth permissions granted
5. ‚úÖ React Native app can scan for devices
6. ‚úÖ UUIDs match exactly between ESP32 and React Native

## üéØ **Success Indicators**

**ESP32 Working:**
- LED blinks 3 times on startup
- Continuous distance readings in Serial Monitor
- LED stays on when React Native connects

**React Native Working:**
- "Connected to Smart Water Bottle" message
- Real-time distance and water level updates
- Green connection status indicator
